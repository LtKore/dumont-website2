                <p>Edwin started out in the hotel business and worked at that for 15 years. Deciding it was time to further discover his passion for hair. 
                He started out in the business at the bottom, and worked his way up to a now 25 long years at the House of Dumont. Edwin worked for Elizabeth Arden as an educator,
